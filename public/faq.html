            <p class="faq-question">How does the self hosting plan work?</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
              Self hosting requires you to setup your own bucket in AWS S3, and
              generate limited-scope credentials for that bucket. Next you'll
              fill out S3 credentials form on the Settings page of the app. Your
              secret key will be encrypted while stored.

            <p class="faq-question">Is there any way to know which files in my shop were created by digiful?</p>
            <p class="faq-answer">
              Yes. Every product created by dijiful gets the tag 'digiful' applied to it.
